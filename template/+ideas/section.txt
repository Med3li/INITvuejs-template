/*store vuex 
        done!    - state for data
        done!  - getters is a edited state version
        done!   - mutations is for changing state or getters on event handling / and add the extra value to edit the state just in methods function
                -actions ??
        done!   - modules is make a little store to every interest component like store for chat, mailing, user
        done!   -mapping Its goal is to prevent functions on the script component file from mixing with other function 
                  in the store just ..mapGet(['increment']) it's easy

state and getters to computed

mutation and actions to methods

*in mutation you can just add a methodsValue in methods not in template

//***********mutation and actions difference************
 
 x=thing from state -
 -in->mutations:commit
 -in->actions:dispatch uses for create many edited copies from mutations function

actions add to mutation the getting of payload from function params in template just with replace commit with 'dispatch'

example:
state{hi:'c'}
in script methods b='bb'
mutations
 f(state, b){
   state.hi +=b
 }
 result==> hi=hibb

actions
 f(s, b+'cvcv')
 s.commit('f', b)
  result==>hi=hibbcvcv

in essence put the origin in mutation and in actions create many changes from this commit
///modules is good for easy handling and organization of the store

in global use actions for the big large and complex applications.
////////-in my opinion don't use vuex vuejs store.
