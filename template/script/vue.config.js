//so registre e component in d locally (import vue in var and fill components in script),registre d and c in B locally,registre A and B in App locally
//or registre all components globally in App and share theme in father components with filling the components in the script of every father componnets
//the difference is import all components in vue config file and share theme 
//in my opinion registre components locally for more regulation and use globally registration just with vue router for more regulation because you forced to create routes in new vue router function in single file (vue config file) and the component is mostly present in father components
//and use
//for future i want to create store for managing components named 'Vuce' (Vue components = Vue c = vuec 'bad' = vuce'good') like vuex for managing data 
//-contain globally components and share it in router components form or locally components form
